## Project 1: Human vs. Non-Human Face Classification
- [ ] **Data Collection:** 
    - [x] Collect 5k human faces (e.g., CelebA or LFW).
    - [x] Collect 5k non-human faces (Anime, Statues, Game CGI).
- [ ] **Preprocessing:**
    - [x] Run face detection/alignment on all images.
    - [x] Resize and normalize images (e.g., 224x224).
- [ ] **Model Development:**
    - [x] Implement a baseline CNN or Transfer Learning with YOLOv11-cls.
    - [x] Set up training loop with data augmentation.
- [ ] **Evaluation:**
    - [x] Analyze Confusion Matrix (False Positives on Statues).
    - [x] Benchmark on validation/test sets.
- [ ] **Development:**
    - [ ] Implement a baseline CNN or Transfer Learning with MobileNetV3/ResNet.
